# Query

## What
Create an application that can be used to manage people's online accounts.
Generic changes to personal information like address changes can be done
on multiple online accounts simultaneously. Amazon, banks, ebay, paypal, takeaway, all registered accounts
will have their address changed rather than the customers doing this individually on unfamiliar websites.
People duplicate work on things which remain constant across 10s of online accounts.

More specific changes that are available on the online section of a business like banks - say renaming an account/changing an overdraft/paying off a credit card are often done on the phone or in branch because the customer has to learn the website to
even find out what they can do. These requests can be done by *Query*.

## Why
Its a massive waster of time for both companies and individuals - digital capability is already there is some cases.

## How
Online application using chat with expert - uber model or just AI. Request - check request - customer confirmation - make changes.
Security is extremely important. Sensitive information will *NEVER* go to operative or be available to _Query_.
